#+title: Outline

* Abstract
 - strucural [[id:5d166652-b634-422a-9342-d57beacdc468][recursion]] via abstract [[id:f166958b-aed6-4a0b-825b-48be4a036190][Trees]]
 - structured outlines are convenient for Humans and bots
 - further iterations might involve bots working towards knowledge discovery
* Incentive
 - unstructured notes have been an issue in the past
 - structuring inputs from the get go help with flexibility in the future
* Outline
 - this is the main outline section that holds domain specific elaborations for the abstract concept
 - these can be bullets denoted with a hyphen or org subtrees depending on how deep the outline needs to be
 - prefer a flat structure for quicker traversal across concepts as dedicated nodes rather than nested ones
 - if an outline is turning into a list rather than a concise overview, another node is probably needed
 - avoid metalinkages
* Links
 - external references
 - all internal links exist in only in the abstract subnode to enforce careful linking considerations and avoid too many cycles
