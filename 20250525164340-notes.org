#+title: Notes

* Abstract
 - aiming for terse exhaustiveness
 - one should be able to follow quickly
 - definite structure to all notes at the top level
 - abstract, incentive (why), outline (tree), (external) links
* Incentive
 - defining how the notes in here are structured
 - for common parsing and inference strategies down the line
 - towards engineering interfaces for bots and humans
* Outline
 - the Abstract will serve as an OverArching conceptual view for the concerned note
 - the incentives serve as the root to why that note particularly exists
 - the outline is where the domain specific dives are noted
   - this is the meta note taking directive so will have overviews of generic approaches
   - No AI slop creating indices in here
   - do leverage AI for interpretation
   - condensed phrases and [[id:43715378-3471-493f-bf76-845553735e4e][jargon]] with further explorations on the jargon in dedicated notes
   - no tags
 - links
   - prefer a flat note structure with further elaboration in dedicated nodes altogether
   - internal links to concepts when using them in the first three nodes
   - the links section only to contain external indices
 - every note may not have all four of these (Abstract,Incentive,Outline, Links)
* Links
