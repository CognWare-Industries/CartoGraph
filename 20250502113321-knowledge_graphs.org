#+title: Knowledge Graphs

* Abstract
 - one of the means of [[id:387bb873-d57a-446b-9042-ace87d0fcc1d][indexing]] [[id:98050118-a477-48cf-a4ff-be362db616fe][knowledge]]
   - via mathematical [[id:42e8c2ec-6418-414d-9c73-08b43d54e243][Graphs]]
* Incentive
 - better interpretability and application potential for humans and bots
* Outline
 - semantically atomic concepts represented as Nodes
 - inter concept linkages via Links
 - following link Chains helps out with analysing emergent pattens
 - clusters help denote pseudo boundaries for inter domain traversal
 - Higher order Patterns emerge upon enough data observations
   - Analogies are patterns that transfer across concept clusters
   - leveraging pattern applications to new domains is a way to observe
* Links
